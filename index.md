## Hello, and i hope you find your stay worthwhile.

This repository was created out of the need to fix the learning gaps i observed in the Nigerian data space; a lot of incomplete information and ineffecient roadmaps or courses. I discovered that the best way to learn is to buld your own path for yourself- something i have had to do for the past year now- i have also realised how grueling of a process that was and how difficult it would be for absolute novices, like myself, to go through that.

I witnessed, firsthand, how difficult it is to get into the *datasphere* in a developing space like Nigeria; it is very overwhelming. With all this in mind, i created this repository of courses that i feel would guide peaople down a more structured, complete and definite path. I dont own any of these courses nor do i gain any money from you using them. I hope you utilise this to the best.

I will also be taking all the courses in the repository over the next year or two and i will consistently be adding courses i find useful and dleting courses i find ineffecient.


## Roadmap of the repository

1. Formal creation of the repository
2. Creation of the repositiory's Github pages
3. Constant updates of the repository and/or pages
4. Actively search for possible (experienced) contributors for the repository


See you at the other end of this journey!

Yours,
