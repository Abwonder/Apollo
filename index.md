## Hello, and i hope you find your stay worthwhile.

Note that these  resources are based on my personal research. If you encounter any other resources that seem better or more reliable, you are free to discard my resources or you could communicate it to me and have the list updated. Please note that some courses have similar content; ignore any repititive content that you might come across.

The [*Data analysis track*](https://github.com/Acemma78/Data_Roadmap/blob/master/Analysis.md#a-skills-needed) is a prerequisite to the Data [Science](https://github.com/Acemma78/Data_Roadmap/blob/master/Science.md#data-science-track) track. Some of the content in the [*Data Engineering*](https://github.com/DataBaby20/Apollo/blob/master/Engineering.md) track are needed for Data Scientists and vice versa, so try going through the entire repository.

After completing the *Excel for Business/Data Visualization with Tableau course*, you can proceed to try out the [KPMG data analytics virtual internship](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship) or other vivrtual internships or bootcamps you come across, to put your new found skills to the test. 

Feel free to reach out in case you have any questions.
